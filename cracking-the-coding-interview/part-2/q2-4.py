"""
Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list the values of x only need
to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the
"right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
EXAMPLE
Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition= 5]
Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
